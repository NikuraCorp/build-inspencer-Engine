  ## The Project  ##
  * .
  * .  
   * Project started in 2021  
  the engine is focused on being made all > JAVA <  ? nah
  
  The Engine uses [LwjGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org) as the main renderer.   
  in the future I will implement  
  * Software Render 
  * and import DirectX 3d libraries into JAVA  \/
  * FIX Directx4j system

## Low Engine Power

Little Performance...  
  
I know sometimes the FPS drops this version is not stable  

Build Inspencer uses Opengl 3.0 + as a renderer promising good graphics for the engine

  this code is easy to modify the lwjgl bookstore has excellent transformable codes with many tutorials on the internet teaching it
  
  
##  Renders

1 LWJGL 3 
OPenGL Library JAVA
*  the [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/guide)
