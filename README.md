## Build Inspencer Game Engine ________________________________________________v0.0.0.3  
  * in memories of [Bud Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Spencer)
  
  
  I started the project with tutorials on the internet there is certainly nothing interesting for "while"! the focus of this engine will be the use of DirectX for java
  
  ## Requirements

|Requirements are included in the project||
|-|-|
| JAVA 8+|`logic`|
| LWJGL 2.9.1                      | `together with Project IN Libraries/jar Folder`                      |
|jdw |`not yet included because Directx is having project problems`|

  ## The Project  ##
  * .
  * .  How setup ?  [ HERE !](https://github.com/NikuraCorp/build-inspencer-Engine/wiki/How-to-setup-it-in-Eclipse-IDE-%3F)
   * Project started in 2021  
   * 
I think this engine should work on old machines with low graphics level. based on computers 2009 
  
  The Engine uses [LwjGL](https://www.lwjgl.org) as the main renderer.   
  in the future I will implement  
  
  * DirectX 4J    DX9/11
  * DX9 is First
