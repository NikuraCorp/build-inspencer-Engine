## Build Inspencer Game Engine ________________________________________________v0.0.0.3  
  in memories of [Bud Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Spencer)
  
  the engine is focused on being made all JAVA
  
The Engine uses LwjGL 3 as the main renderer.  
in the future I will implement Software Render and import the DirectX 3d libraries into JAVA

## Low Engine Power

Little Performance...  
  
I know sometimes the FPS drops this version is not stable  

Build Inspencer uses Opengl 3.0 + as a renderer promising good graphics for the engine

  this code is easy to modify the lwjgl bookstore has excellent transformable codes with many tutorials on the internet teaching it
